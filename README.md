Student Burnout Detection System

An AI-based system that predicts student burnout levels using psychological, academic, and lifestyle indicators. The system is built using Logistic Regression and deployed as a real-time web application using Streamlit.

 Problem Statement

Student burnout often goes unnoticed until it significantly impacts academic performance and mental well-being. Early detection can help provide timely intervention and support.

This project aims to classify students into:

 0.No Burnout

 1.Mild Burnout

 2.Severe Burnout
based on behavioral and mental health factors.
